The full task of the poject is in libft_task.pdf

Also there're some more complicated funcs: split (it frees everything it has already "malloced" if any of malloc returns "NULL"), strjoin, strdup.

As bonus part of project recoded func for working with lists. Creating, adding to front, deliting, getting length of list and so on (Look at ft_lst... funcs).
